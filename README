Ghost 0.0.1
===========

A gem that allows you to create, list, and modify .local hostnames in 10.5 with ease...

Intended Usage
==============

This gem is designed primarily for web developers who need to add and modify hostnames to their system for virtual hosts on their local/remote web server

    $ ghost add mydevsite.local
    [Added] mydevsite.local -> 127.0.0.1

    $ ghost add staging-server.local 67.207.136.164
    [Added] staging-server -> 67.207.136.164

    $ ghost list
    mydevsite.local -> 127.0.0.1
    staging-server  -> 67.207.136.164
    
    $ ghost delete mydevsite.local
    [Deleted] mydevsite.local
    
    $ ghost list
    staging-server  -> 67.207.136.164
    
    $ ghost add staging-server.local 72.14.207.99
    [Error] staging-server.local already exists (-> 67.207.136.164)
            Use `ghost modify` to change the entry
            
    $ ghost modify staging-server.local 72.14.207.99
    [Modifying] staging-server.local -> 72.14.207.99
    
    $ ghost empty
    Host list has been emptied
    
There is also a library that can be used in Ruby scripts. The `ghost` command is a wrapper for
the library. View the source of `bin/ghost` to see how to use the library.

    sudo gem install bjeanes-ghost --source http://gems.github.com/
    
Notes
=====

This library is not fully implemented yet. I am just putting this README up so that you can 
see what the goals are.
