<h1>Ghost 0.0.1</h1>

<p>A gem that allows you to create, list, and modify local hostnames in 10.5 with ease...</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>This command is designed for users of Mac OS X Leopard and relies on a tool which I am pretty 
sure was not in earlier versions of OS X and definitely isn't in other OSes. This uses the <code>dscl</code>
command to intelligently add hostnames to the database. An adapter to use the hosts file in other OSes is definitely a possibility, but not a priority at this time. Feel free to add it yourself and I'll merge it.</p>

<h1>Intended Usage</h1>

<p>This gem is designed primarily for web developers who need to add and modify hostnames to their system for virtual hosts on their local/remote web server. However, it could be of use to other people who would otherwise modify their <code>/etc/hosts</code> file and flush the cache.</p>

<h2>Command</h2>

<pre><code>$ ghost add mydevsite.local
[Added] mydevsite.local -&gt; 127.0.0.1

$ ghost add staging-server.local 67.207.136.164
[Added] staging-server -&gt; 67.207.136.164

$ ghost list
mydevsite.local -&gt; 127.0.0.1
staging-server  -&gt; 67.207.136.164

$ ghost delete mydevsite.local
[Deleted] mydevsite.local

$ ghost list
staging-server  -&gt; 67.207.136.164

$ ghost add staging-server.local 72.14.207.99
[Error] staging-server.local already exists (-&gt; 67.207.136.164)
        Use `ghost modify` to change the entry

$ ghost modify staging-server.local 72.14.207.99
[Modifying] staging-server.local -&gt; 72.14.207.99

$ ghost empty
Host list has been emptied

<h2>Library</h2>

<p>There is also a library that can be used in Ruby scripts. The <code>ghost</code> command is a wrapper for
the library. View the source of <code>bin/ghost</code> to see how to use the library.</p>

<h2>Sake Task</h2>

<p>I also want to make this available as a Sake task to cater those who use it. It too will be a wrapper for the library. I just have to figure out how I can provide an easy way to install the sake tasks via the gem</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<pre><code>sudo gem install bjeanes-ghost --source http://gems.github.com/
</code></pre>

<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>This library is not fully implemented yet. I am just putting this README up so that you can 
see what the goals are.</p>
